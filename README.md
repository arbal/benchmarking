# benchmarking
You Will need two packages
1. fio
2. iozone3

The scripts which begin with fioxxx.sh are meant to be run from inside the directory where your filesystem is mounted that
you wish to benchmark.

The dh1.sh scripts you will need to change the drep1 with whatever the name of your filesystem is

These scripts I wrote for my own use, so I really didn't set them  up for general use.  Maybe will update them.
